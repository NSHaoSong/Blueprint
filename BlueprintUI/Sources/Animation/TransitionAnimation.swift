         Example
         ---------
         Consider the below example of Element A and Element B, where B is nested inside A.
         
         If A and B both have animation transitions, and appear at the same time, only A's transition
         will be performed â€“ B will be animated within A's transition.
         
         However, if A is already visible, and then B is added later on, B's animation transition will be
         performed as normal, because it is not nested.
         
         ```
         Element A
         +---------------------+
         | Element B           |
         | +-----------------+ |
